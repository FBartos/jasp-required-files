Converts class labels to the default choice of numeric 0s and 1s
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Converts class labels to the default choice of numeric 0s and 1s according to a specific set of conventions.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
relabel(labels)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>labels</code></td>
<td>

<p>a vector/array of labels, with two levels
</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function turns a vector of class labels into the default format: a numeric array with levels 0 and 1. It accepts numeric, logical, and factor arrays, and performs the conversion in accordance with the following conventions. For a numeric vector with values a and b, the minimum of (a,b) will be mapped to 0 and their maximum to 1. For a logical vector with values TRUE and FALSE, TRUE is mapped to 1 and FALSE to 0. Levels of a factor are interpreted as character strings and then mapped to 0s and 1s in alphabetical order, e.g., &quot;male&quot; is mapped to 1, and &quot;female&quot; to 0, and similarly &quot;true&quot; is mapped to 1 and &quot;false&quot; to 0. This convention being arbitrary, the user must make sure (s)he is happy with the results. For instance, if the labels are &quot;cases/non-cases&quot;, the default mapping maps &quot;cases&quot; to 0s, whereas 1s would have been the intuitive choice in this instance. To avoid confusion, a message is produced describing the switch whenever one happens. 
</p>
<p>The code will complain if the number of distinct labels in the input vector is not 2.
